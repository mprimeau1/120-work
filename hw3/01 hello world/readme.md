# This week was interesting I got to learn more about pj5 and how to do some new basic things.  
# I learned about backgrounds and canvas, about how to change the color mostly.
# I also learned about functions and some simple ones like stepup and draw.
# With setup you always want to have that first then you can have whatever function
# after that, like draw.  You can use draw for several things like making an ellipse.

#The biggest problem I had figuring out how to make a webpage. I read some issues
#that other people were having and read that.
